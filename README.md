A Java project (game) called Deploy and Destroy. It was a project at my university, in module called Programming Principles and Algorithms (CCS1110) and Programming Methodology and Design (CCS1115).
Project is not 100% the same as my university module, but more like 95%.

Made by Angelos Thanasaj @ University of York (Athens Tech College).

Enjoy.
